<p>I've been working on writing a <a href="http://avalanchelab.com/help/" title="Avalanche Lab Manual">manual for Avalanche Lab</a>  the last couple weeks, it's long over due, but it is finally available.  The manual is still a work in progress(Avalanche Lab has a lot of features), but it covers the basics of entering observations.</p>
