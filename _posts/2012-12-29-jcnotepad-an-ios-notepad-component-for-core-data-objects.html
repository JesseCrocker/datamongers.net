<p>It seems like almost every IOS app i've worked on at some point ends with a core-data entity with an attribute called "notes", and there is a need for for a view for entering notes about the object.  I've developed a component called JCNotePad that is designed to look likes the built in Notes app, to be used for this purpose.  It can also be easily modified to look like graph paper.  Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/JesseCrocker/JCNotePad">GitHub</a>.</p>
